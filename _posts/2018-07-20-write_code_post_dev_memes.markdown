I am perpetualy distracted. I procrastinate best by looking for funny and clever humor in hard to reach areas of the web. I've established a system where each day that I spend focused time working on code and making github contributions, I will reward myself by posting a new humorous dev joke ona new instagram page I created just for this task. I'll update this post over te weekend with the relevant info and look forard to sharing this part of my journey, too,.
