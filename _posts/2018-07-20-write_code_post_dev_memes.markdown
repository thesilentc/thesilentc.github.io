I am perpetually distracted. I procrastinate best by looking for funny and clever humor in hard to reach areas of the web. I've established a system where each day that I spend focused time working on code and making GitHub contributions, I will reward myself by posting a new humorous dev joke on a new instagram page I created just for this task. I'll update this post over the weekend with the relevant info and look forward to sharing this part of my journey, too,.
