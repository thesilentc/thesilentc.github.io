Today is my birthday. I'm not bragging or looking for attention. Ok, maybe a little, but I'm looking forward to writing code here with the learn.community... 

2016 was a very strange year. It feels as if human consciousness stumbled in the universe and we landed in a different timeline than where we started. It difficult to explain, but I imagine you understand what I'm talking about.

Here's to a far less weird 2017.
