Ask any two well established web developers about learning to code today and you will get two passionate answers that are simultaneaously similar and yet quite disparate. I interviwed scores of programmers and read a multitude of articles and blog posts about learning to code. Here’s what I have extrapolated;

1: All successful coders love to code

2: Their way of coding is better than anyone else’s.

The moment I realized that common mindset was litteraly everywhere I knew that I was on my way home. Those are the key ingredients in any discussion that can propel the growth of an idea. Two passionate beings who love a thing yet view it from two polar perspectives is the unltimate pinacle of creativity.

And how apropo, btw? In a world of duality, what better way to evolve the coding universe than to have a kerfufle or two over what eventually all boils down to 1’s and 0’s? 

So what language should I learn first?

Ruby?

Node.js?

One great piece of advice I received seemed like a solid token of wisdom. My friend told me that “You have to learn to look down on other programmers for their choice of language and tools."

I mean, if I’m going to code all day long forever, I might as well have fun, too.

Yesterday I finished making a Tic-Tac-Toe board using Ruby and I am indeed having a very good time learning how to code.
